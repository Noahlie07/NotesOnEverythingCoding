### What is Dify?
Dify is an open-source platform for developing AI applications without using much code. It contains both ready-made AI applications for us to try with their UI or extract to our own applications via their API, and an interface for us to create our own AI application to be tried and extracted.  

#### Application Types  
Dify offers five application types with both example templates and blank templates for us to plug, play, and extract.
1. Chatbot - A conversational LLM
2. Text generator - for text generation tasks like writing stories, reports, etc
3. Agent - A conversational intelligent assistant capable of task decomposition, reasoning, and tool invocation
4. Chatflow - A workflow orchestration for multi-round complex dialogue tasks with memory capabilities
5. Workflow - A workflow orchestration for single-round tasks like automation and batch processing
