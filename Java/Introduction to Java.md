# Introduction to Java

## How a Java Program Works and Naming Conventions  
A .java file can only contain **one public class**. The name of the public class has to match with the name of the .java file.  
The public class must have a main() function, which will be the only function that will be run when the program is ran.  
Conventionally, this public class and main() function acts as a launcher class for other classes.  

All class names must start with a capital letter.  
Method names conventionally follow camelCase naming convention.  
Variable names (instances and local variables) also follow camelCase.  
Constant names follow SNAKE_CASE with all uppercase letters.  

Curly brackets are used to represent blocks of code. Indentation does not matter.  

## JDK, JVE, AND JVM  
JDK: JDK stands for Java Development Kit. It is a set of development tools and libraries used to create Java programs. It works together with the JVM and JRE to run and build Java applications..
JRE: JRE stands for Java Runtime Environment, and it provides an environment to run Java programs on the system. The environment includes Standard Libraries and JVM.
JVM: JVM stands for Java Virtual Machine. It's responsible for executing the Java program.
