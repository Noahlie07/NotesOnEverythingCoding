# Access Modifiers  

In Java, access modifiers are essential tools that define how the members of a class, like variables, methods, and even the class itself, can be accessed from other parts of our program.  

## Types of Access Modifiers  
There are four types of access modifiers:
1. default - no keyword needed - accessible only within the same package/program file
2. public - accessible from anywhere
3. protected - accessible only within the same package + any subclass of the class
4. private - accessible only within the same class
